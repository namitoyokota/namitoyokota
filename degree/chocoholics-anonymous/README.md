# Chocoholics-Anonymous
For CS 200 (Software Design and Engineering) Course at UA, in a team of five including myself, we developed a software for Chocoholics Anonymous (ChocAn), an organization dedicated to helping people addicted to chocolate in all its glorious forms.

## Concept
Members pay a monthly fee to ChocAn entitled to unlimited consultations and treatments with health professionals. Each health care professional, provider, provides service to ChocAn members. ChocAn user, operators, can manage accounts for those members and providers. Managers are also another ChocAn member that can request reports for further research. More information can be found in 'manual/ChocAn.pdf'.

## Steps
To run this software, a runnable jar is already outputted under 'release/ChocAn.jar'. By double clicking the file, the software will start running.

## Tools Used
 - Eclipse
 - BitBucket
 - Java
 - Swing (Java GUI)
