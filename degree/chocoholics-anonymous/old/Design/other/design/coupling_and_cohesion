A good design must have high cohesion and low coupling. High cohesion implies a high degree of interaction within a module, 
whereas low coupling indicates a low degree of interaction between two modules. Observing our UML class diagram above, we can
agree that our design exhibits high cohesion and low coupling therefore our design is “good”. Evidence of low coupling is 
demonstrated where the ‘Records’ class has a composite aggregate association to the ‘Entry’ class. This minimizes the number
of connections between classes and encourages reusability. An instance of high cohesion can be observed in the ‘Records’ class
which exhibits the qualifications for the best type of cohesion- informational. The ‘Records’ class performs multiple actions- 
each with its own entry point, independent code for each action such as ‘addRecord’ or ‘getRecord’, and performs on the same
data structure- ‘data’. Therefore, this encourages high interaction within the class and avoids high interaction between these 
classes.
