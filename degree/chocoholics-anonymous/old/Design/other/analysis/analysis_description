Our organization is responsible for designing the data processing software that will be 
employed during healthcare and billing related services. Another organization will be designing 
a communications software to establish communication between our software and third-party 
organizations. Particularly, our software will need to communicate with the Data Center to 
verify memberships. A monitor, keyboard, and card reader will be required to allow providers 
to interact with our software to provide services and managers can review summary reports. 
The data generated from our software, such as member and provider reports, EFT data, and 
provider directory will be stored in files and member numbers will be stored at the Data Center.
