# Introduction

1.1 - What is Data Mining

- Data mining is the process of automatically discovering useful information in large data repositories
- Data mining is an integral part of knowledge discovery in databases (KDD), which is the overall process of converting raw data into useful information.
- The purpose of preprocessing is to transform the raw input data into an appropriate format for subsequent analysis
- Postprocessing ensures that only valid and useful results are incorporated into the decision support system

  1.2 - Motivating Challenges

- Scalability
- High dimensionality
- Heterogeneous and complex data
- Data ownership and distribution
- Non-traditional analysis

  1.3 - The Origin of Data Mining

- Data science is an interdisciplinary field that studies and applies tools and techniques for deriving useful insights from data

  1.4 - Data Mining Tasks
  2 Major Categories of Data Mining Tasks

- Predictive tasks - the objective is to predict the value of a particular attribute based on the values of other attributes
- Descriptive tasks- the objective it to derive patterns that summarize the underlying relationships in data

Predictive modeling refers to the task of building a model for the target variable as a function of the explanatory variables

2 Types of Predictive Modeling Tasks

- Classification - used for discrete target variables
- Regression - used for continuous target variables

- Association analysis is used to discover patterns that describe strongly associated features in the data
- Cluster analysis seeks to find groups of closely related observations so that observations that belong to the same cluster are more similar to each other than observations that belong to other clusters
- Anomaly detection is the task of identifying observations whose characteristics are significantly different from the rest of the data
- These observations are known as anomalies or outliers
