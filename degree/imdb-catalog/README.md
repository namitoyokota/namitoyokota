# IMDb Catalog

## Objective
Utilizing different data structures and algorithms, I developed a IMDb Catalog that users can create, retrieve, update, and delete (CRUD) records. This program loads the lookup dataset into memory then controlled through curses user interface. Multiple users are denoted by multiple datafiles (.log).
